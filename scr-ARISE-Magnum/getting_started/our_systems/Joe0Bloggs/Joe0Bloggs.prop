This install puts Viper4Android in a relatively compact system with just ARISE core and Dolby Atmos, together with the various V4A profiles devised by ARISE team members.  One of these profiles is a new one I made called "Joe0Bloggs Viper4ARISE".  Selecting this profile with this install should satisfy all your cravings for extra bass, clarity and soundstage on headphones ("surround effect") using just ARISE core and V4A.  This install uses fewer modules so can possibly consume less CPU and battery for a given level of sound quality.  If you feel that the bass is too much, try turning off ViPER-DDC (because it's running a custom bass boosting DDC in my profile).

Another is called Joe0Bloggs for ARISE--Bluetooth stereo speakers.  These are designed to enhance the bass and soundstage of small bluetooth stereo speakers.  It assumes that you aren't able to place the speakers as far apart as the golden triangle law dictates, and expands the soundstage via a cross-channel impulse response convolver.

Dolby Atmos is included with this install as one of the few other things to play with.  I recommend trying the Surround Virtualizer on a flat EQ and turning off Convolver on V4A (since it runs my own take on a surround virtualizer and you should run only one of these virtualizers at one time for good effect).
