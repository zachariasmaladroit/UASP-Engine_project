 #Secone's setup as follows, great for IEMs!
#viper: only srs_2_1.irs in convolver
#ice: deluxe, using attached preset
#dirac, 3db treble boost 2db baritone boost, bass adjust as needed

I've loved every step of this journey that's been taken, and I hope everyone else agrees when I say it's been well worth it. I can't imagine a better group of people than you all. Cheers to making each day better with a healthy dose of bass!
