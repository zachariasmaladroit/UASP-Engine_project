<b>ICEsound™ Configuration</b>


* The configuration file for ICEsound is currently available in six different versions.


* Not all six will always be compatible with a particular device.


* This is a way to experiment with a different configuration if ICEsound™ is preventing other signal processing, like ViPER4Arise™ for example.


* <b>ICEconfig 1</b> is the default configuration.

* <b>ICEconfigs 2, 3, 4, 5,</b> and <b>6</b> are alternative configurations using different settings to hopefully provide at least one satisfactory configuration.

* Final alternative: using no ICEsound™ configuration file at all.
